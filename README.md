# adventofcode_2023
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) Python Challenge

## Event Details
The event will run from December 1st at Midnight EST (UTC-5) to December 21st Midnight EST (UTC-5).

Each day at midnight EST Starting December 1st through December 25th, there will be a new puzzle released on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). They will increasingly get harder each day. 😁

## Getting Started
We will be using Google Collab for a managed code environment.

### Setup

##### adventofcode.com

1. Go to [adventofcode.com/2023](adventofcode.com/2023)
2. Click on the line corresponding to the day/puzzle you want to work on
3. Read the Puzzle Primer
4. Click `get your puzzle input` near the bottom
5. Copy & Paste the input into a text file for use later
6. Optionally, if you'd like to see your self on the global leaderboard, you can head to the bottom of the page and log in with your preferred method.


##### Repo
1. Fork this repo!
    + copy the new repos name 
    + `github.com/lord-skinner/adventofcode_2023` would be `lord-skinner/adventofcode_2023`
2. Log into [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. Click the Github Tab in the Explorer
4. In the field labeled `Enter a GitHub URL or search by organization or user` paste your repos name.
5. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `main.ipynb`.
6. Click File > Save A Copy in Github  (this allows for you to save changes back in Github)
7. On the left bar, click the file icon, then the first icon under `Files` with the up arrow on it.
8. Navigate to the file on your local machine and upload it.
9. Get started solving the puzzle!

A hint to get started, the text file will be available at path `/content/<your_file>.txt` and can be referenced in you code like: 

```python
with open("/content/day1.txt", "r") as input:
  print(input.read(100))
```

This will read the first 100 characters in the file and print them to the console for you to inspect.

## Rules

1. You many only use [Python 3.10](https://docs.python.org/3.10/) or [Standard Python Libraries](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/index.html), no Python Packages are allowed!
2. No AI or GenAI, it will help you be faster at coding once you are proficient, but really slows down the learning process for those working to become proficient.
3. For a challenge to be considered `complete` you must have the code and solution in your forked repo.
4. Fastest Runtime Challenge
    + The hardest challenge completed 
    + More than 1 answer submitted

## Prizes
There will be prizes along the way!

- Most Challenges Completed
- Most Efficient Code
 - Fewest Lines
 - Fastest Runtime

# Bonus Challenge 
Pick any tool you are familiar with, anything from a calculator to Excel to SQL to Mulesoft and solve the problem once you've done it on Python.
